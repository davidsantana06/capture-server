### ðŸ“š Docs

This documentation serves as a guide for developers and users to understand how to interact with the application. It succinctly describes the applicationâ€™s operation, including access to each available route and event. Modules are represented with 'ðŸ§©', detailing their access points, with input (user) indicated by 'ðŸ“¥' and output (server) by 'ðŸ“¤', with real examples.

### ðŸ§© Error

Centralizes exception handling, providing standardized responses to the user in message format for exceptions originating from WebSocket events and in JSON format for HTTP requests. The unique error cases handled are **Not Found (404)** and **Internal Server Error (500)**. Other cases are treated as generic.

- **ðŸ“¤ WebSocket Output**: _simple message with description_

  ```text
  Resource not found.
  ```

- **ðŸ“¤ HTTP Output**: _JSON with description, named as "message"_

  ```json
  { "message": "Internal server error." }
  ```
