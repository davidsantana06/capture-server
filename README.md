### üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Configuration

#### üóÑÔ∏è Server

The system was developed using **Python 3.12**, and it is recommended to use this version to ensure compatibility. You will need to obtain a local copy of the source code, which can be done with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidsantana06/capture-server
```

Once you have the files, create a `.env` file based on the template provided in `.env.example`. In this file, specify the following field:

- `ALLOWED_HOSTS` - A list of addresses (or domains) allowed to make requests to the server, separated by space.

Next, install the application dependencies using the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, start the server with:

```bash
flask --app app run
```

#### üñ•Ô∏è Client

The client can be integrated via the [**Images Folder - Client**](https://github.com/DiovanaS/images-folder/tree/main/client) by following the configuration instructions.

### ‚öñÔ∏è License

This project adopts the **MIT License**, which allows you to use and make modifications to the code as you wish. The only thing I ask is that proper credit is given, acknowledging the effort and time I invested in building it.
