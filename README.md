### üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Configuration

The system was developed using **Python 3.12**, and it is recommended to use this version to ensure compatibility.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone Repository

You will need to obtain a local copy of the source code, which can be done with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidsantana06/capture-server
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Environment

Once you have the files, create a `.env` file based on the template provided in `.env.example`, and specify the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` field as a space-separated list of addresses or domains that are allowed to make requests to the server.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

Next, install the application dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run

Finally, start the server with:

```bash
flask --app app run
```

### üíª Client

The client can be integrated by following the configuration instructions available in the [**üîó Images Folder - Client**](https://github.com/DiovanaS/images-folder/tree/main/client).

### ‚öñÔ∏è License

This project adopts the **MIT License**, which allows you to use and make modifications to the code as you wish. The only thing I ask is that proper credit is given, acknowledging the effort and time I invested in building it.
